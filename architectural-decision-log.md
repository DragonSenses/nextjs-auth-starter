# Architectural decision log

This is the documentation for the process of building the project, which gives some insight behind certain choices and design decisions. 

This also facilitates the [onboarding process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding), which helps others be informed and caught up to speed.

# NextJS Authentication Starter

Authentication is a core feature for nearly all applications, so this project provides a robust foundation for secure web applications.

## Benefits

1. **Time Savings**: It provides a ready-to-use foundation, significantly reducing the time needed to set up authentication from scratch for new projects.

2. **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent authentication setup across multiple projects, which can help maintain best practices and reduce errors.

3. **Security**: By using a well-tested starter template, you can ensure that common security vulnerabilities are addressed, providing a more secure authentication system.

4. **Scalability**: A starter template can be designed to handle various authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, email/password, passwordless), making it easier to scale and adapt to different project requirements.

5. **Learning Tool**: It serves as an excellent resource for developers to learn how to implement authentication in Next.js, especially for those new to the framework or authentication concepts.

6. **Community Contribution**: Sharing a starter template can help the developer community by providing a reliable starting point, fostering collaboration, and improving overall code quality.

7. **Customization**: It allows for easy customization and extension, enabling developers to tailor the authentication system to specific project needs without starting from scratch.

8. **Best Practices**: Embeds best practices for authentication, session management, and security, ensuring that new projects adhere to high standards from the beginning.

## Project Configuration

### Install Next.js

Let's get started with [Next.js 14 - App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs).

- [Nextjs Installation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Now we answer the prompts that defines the set up of our project

```sh
What is your project named? my-app
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... [No] / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? ... [No] / Yes
```

chore: Initialize Next.js 14 app router project

#### Install shadcn-ui

The next step is to initialize [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next).

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```sh
Need to install the following packages:
  shadcn-ui@0.6.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / [yes]
```

chore: Configure shadcn/ui for project

### globals.css

#### Use full viewport height

To ensure that the entire viewport height is utilized, inside `globals.css` add the following code:

style: Use full viewport height for better layout

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

html,
body,
:root {
  height: 100%;
}
```

#### TailwindCSS and @layer

- [Using CSS and @layer | TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-css-and-layer)

Tailwind groups styles into *layers* because in CSS, the order of the rules in your stylesheet decides which declaration wins when two selectors have the same specificity: 

```css
.btn {
  background: blue;
  /* ... */
}

.bg-black {
  background: black;
}
```

Here, both buttons will be black since `.bg-black` comes after `.btn` in the CSS:

```tsx
<button class="btn bg-black">...</button>
<button class="bg-black btn">...</button>
```

To manage this, Tailwind organizes the styles it generates into three different "layers" — a concept popularized by [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/#what-is-itcss).

  - The `base` layer is for things like reset rules or default styles applied to plain HTML elements.
  - The `components` layer is for class-based styles that you want to be able to override with utilities.
  - The `utilities` layer is for small, single-purpose classes that should always take precedence over any other styles.

Being explicit about this makes it easier to understand how your styles will interact with each other, and using the `@layer` directive lets you control the final declaration order while still organizing your actual code in whatever way you like.

##### Adding custom utilities in TailwindCSS

- [Adding custom utilities | TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-utilities)

Add any of your own custom utility classes to Tailwind's utilities layer. This can be useful when there's a CSS feature you'd like to use in your project that Tailwind doesn't include utilities for out of the box.

Let's add a page background gradient utility class named `page-bg-gradient`.

style: Add page-bg-gradient utility class

`app\globals.css`
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  .page-bg-gradient {
    @apply bg-[radial-gradient(ellipse_at_top,_var(--tw-gradient-stops))] from-sky-400 to-blue-800;
  }
}
```

This leverages Tailwind's utility-first principles while allowing us to create reusable and maintainable custom classes.

Now use the custom utility class in the JSX:

refactor: Remove boilerplate code from Home page

- Simplified the Home component by removing unnecessary boilerplate code
- Added the page background gradient utility class

`app\page.tsx`
```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="page-bg-gradient">
      Home
    </main>
  );
}
```
